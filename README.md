# Causal Inference 

## Business Need
Judea Pearl and his research group have developed in the last decades a solid theoretical framework to deal with that, but the first steps toward merging it with mainstream machine learning are just beginning. 

The causal graph is a central object in the framework mentioned above, but it is often unknown, subject to personal knowledge and bias, or loosely connected to the available data. The main objective of the task is to highlight the importance of the matter in a concrete way. In this spirit, trainees are expected to attempt the following tasks:
      <li>Perform a causal inference task using Pearlâ€™s framework;
      <li>Infer the causal graph from observational data and then validate the graph;
      <li>Merge machine learning with causal inference;</li>
